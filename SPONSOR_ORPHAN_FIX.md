# Orphaned Sponsor Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When you created a test branch with a school logo and later deleted it, the branch was removed from the `branches` table, but the associated sponsor entry in the `sponsors` table wasn't automatically deleted. This caused:

1. **Orphaned Sponsor Records**: Sponsor entries with `branch_id = NULL`
2. **Broken Image References**: Sponsor carousel trying to load non-existent images
3. **Visual Issues**: Missing or broken images in the sponsor carousel

## Root Cause
The original sponsors table was created with:
```sql
branch_id INT REFERENCES branches(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

This means when a branch is deleted, the sponsor's `branch_id` is set to NULL instead of deleting the sponsor entirely.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Database Cleanup Scripts**
Created two SQL scripts to fix the issue:

- **`fix_orphaned_sponsors.sql`**: Basic cleanup for immediate fix
- **`comprehensive_sponsor_cleanup.sql`**: Complete cleanup with verification

### 2. **Fixed Foreign Key Constraint**
Updated the foreign key constraint to:
```sql
branch_id INT REFERENCES branches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

Now when a branch is deleted, its associated sponsor is automatically deleted too.

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Added error handling to the sponsor carousel component (`components/sponsor-carousel.tsx`):
- Gracefully handles missing images
- Hides sponsors with broken image links
- Logs warnings for debugging

### 4. **Updated Schema Files**
Updated `sponsors_table_schema.sql` to use CASCADE DELETE for future deployments.

## How to Fix Your Current Issue

### Option 1: Run the Cleanup Script (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the `comprehensive_sponsor_cleanup.sql` script
3. This will:
   - Show current sponsor status
   - Remove orphaned school sponsors
   - Fix the foreign key constraint
   - Verify the cleanup worked

### Option 2: Manual Database Check
If you want to see what's in your database first:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sponsors WHERE branch_id IS NULL AND sponsor_type = 'school';
```

Then delete orphaned entries:
```sql
DELETE FROM sponsors WHERE branch_id IS NULL AND sponsor_type = 'school';
```

### Option 3: Complete Reset (Nuclear Option)
If you want to start completely fresh with just the original sponsors, uncomment the reset section in `comprehensive_sponsor_cleanup.sql`.

## Prevention for Future
With the updated foreign key constraint (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), this issue won't happen again. When you delete a test branch in the future, its associated sponsor will be automatically removed.

## Verification
After running the cleanup, you can verify the fix by:
1. Checking the sponsor carousel loads without errors
2. No missing images in the carousel
3. Running: `SELECT * FROM sponsors WHERE is_active = true;` to see clean data

## Files Changed
- ✅ `fix_orphaned_sponsors.sql` - Basic cleanup script
- ✅ `comprehensive_sponsor_cleanup.sql` - Complete cleanup script  
- ✅ `sponsors_table_schema.sql` - Updated to use CASCADE DELETE
- ✅ `components/sponsor-carousel.tsx` - Added error handling
- ✅ This documentation file

The issue should be completely resolved after running the cleanup script!
