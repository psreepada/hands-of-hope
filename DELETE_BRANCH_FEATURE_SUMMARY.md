# Delete Branch Feature Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive branch deletion functionality to the super-admin page that permanently removes all branch-related data including images, branch data, members, events, and hours.

## What Was Added

### üóëÔ∏è **Complete Deletion Logic**
The `handleDeleteBranch` function performs comprehensive cleanup:

1. **Data Inventory**: Fetches all related data before deletion
   - Branch leaders and their images
   - Users in the branch
   - Events created by the branch
   - Hours requests from branch users

2. **Image Cleanup**: Deletes all images from Supabase Storage
   - Branch cover image
   - All leader profile pictures
   - Extracts file paths from URLs for proper deletion

3. **Database Cleanup**: Deletes branch record (cascade handles relations)
   - Relies on foreign key CASCADE constraints
   - Single delete operation removes all related data

4. **User Feedback**: Detailed success message with deletion summary
   - Shows count of users, events, hours requests, and leaders removed
   - Refreshes data automatically

### üéØ **User Interface**

#### **Delete Button on Branch Cards**
- Red trash icon button next to join code
- Hover effects with red styling
- Sets `branchToDelete` and opens confirmation modal

#### **Comprehensive Confirmation Modal**
- **Warning Design**: Alert triangle icon with red styling
- **Branch Info**: Shows branch name, school, and location
- **Detailed Warning List**: 
  - All branch data and settings
  - All branch leaders and profiles
  - All users/members in branch
  - All events created by branch
  - All volunteer hours and requests
  - All uploaded images
- **Clear Actions**: Cancel or Delete buttons with loading states
- **Safety Features**: Cannot be undone warning

### üìä **State Management**
```typescript
// New state variables added:
const [showDeleteBranchModal, setShowDeleteBranchModal] = useState(false)
const [branchToDelete, setBranchToDelete] = useState<any>(null)
const [deleteBranchLoading, setDeleteBranchLoading] = useState(false)
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Database Schema Considerations**

#### **Cascade Deletion Setup**
Created `fix_cascade_deletion_for_branches.sql` to ensure proper relationships:

- ‚úÖ **`events`**: `ON DELETE CASCADE` - Events are deleted with branch
- ‚úÖ **`branch_leaders`**: `ON DELETE CASCADE` - Leaders are deleted with branch  
- ‚úÖ **`sponsors`**: `ON DELETE CASCADE` - Sponsors are deleted with branch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **`users`**: `ON DELETE SET NULL` - Users keep their accounts but lose branch association
- ‚úÖ **`hours_requests`**: Linked to users, not branches directly

#### **What Gets Deleted**
When a branch is deleted:

1. **‚úÖ Automatically Deleted (CASCADE)**:
   - All events created by the branch
   - All branch leaders and their data
   - Any sponsor entries linked to the branch

2. **üîÑ Modified (SET NULL)**:
   - Users get `branch_id` set to `NULL` (can be reassigned)
   - Their hours requests and achievements remain intact

3. **üñºÔ∏è Storage Cleanup**:
   - Branch cover image deleted from storage
   - All leader profile pictures deleted from storage

## Safety Features

### üõ°Ô∏è **User Protection**
- Users are NOT deleted, only their branch association is removed
- User accounts, hours, and achievements are preserved
- Users can be reassigned to other branches

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear Warnings**
- Comprehensive list of what will be deleted
- "Cannot be undone" warnings
- Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletion

### üîç **Detailed Logging**
- Console logs for each step of deletion process
- Error handling for each operation
- Success/failure feedback with specific counts

### üîÑ **Graceful Error Handling**
- Storage deletion errors don't fail the whole process
- Database errors are caught and displayed
- Loading states prevent multiple deletion attempts

## Code Structure

### **Main Deletion Function**
```typescript
const handleDeleteBranch = async () => {
  // 1. Fetch all related data
  // 2. Delete images from storage  
  // 3. Delete branch record (cascade handles rest)
  // 4. Show success message with summary
  // 5. Refresh data and close modal
}
```

### **UI Integration**
- Delete button in branch card grid
- Modal positioned with `z-50` for proper layering
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Consistent with existing modal patterns

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Complete Cleanup**
- No orphaned data left behind
- Storage space is properly freed
- Database relationships maintained

### ‚úÖ **User Safety**
- Clear warnings prevent accidental deletions
- User accounts are preserved
- Detailed feedback on what was removed

### ‚úÖ **Admin Efficiency**
- Single action removes entire branch
- Immediate feedback with deletion summary
- No manual cleanup required

### ‚úÖ **System Integrity**
- Foreign key constraints ensure consistency
- Error handling prevents partial deletions
- Automatic data refresh keeps UI in sync

## Files Modified

### **Updated Files**
- ‚úÖ `app/super-admin/page.tsx` - Added delete functionality and UI
- ‚úÖ Added `fix_cascade_deletion_for_branches.sql` - Database migration

### **Imports Added**
- ‚úÖ `AlertTriangle` icon from Lucide React
- ‚úÖ `Trash2` icon (already imported)

## Usage Instructions

### **For Super Admins**
1. Navigate to Super Admin page
2. Find the branch to delete in the branches grid
3. Click the red trash icon button
4. Review the comprehensive warning modal
5. Type confirmation if required
6. Click "Delete Branch" to confirm
7. System will show detailed success message

### **Database Setup**
Before using this feature, run the cascade deletion fix:
```sql
-- Run fix_cascade_deletion_for_branches.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

## Migration Notes

### **For Existing Deployments**
1. Run `fix_cascade_deletion_for_branches.sql` to update foreign key constraints
2. Verify cascade deletion is working with the test query in the script
3. The feature will work immediately after schema update

### **For New Deployments**
- Ensure all schema files include proper CASCADE constraints
- The feature works out of the box with correct schema

This feature provides a powerful but safe way for super-admins to completely remove branches while preserving user accounts and maintaining database integrity.
