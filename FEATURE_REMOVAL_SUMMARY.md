- ⚠️ Must manually manage sponsors if needed

### **For System**
- ✅ Reduced complexity in branch creation
- ✅ No orphaned sponsor entries from deleted test branches
- ✅ Cleaner separation between branches and sponsors

## Files Modified

### **Updated Files**
- ✅ `app/super-admin/page.tsx` - Removed school logo form fields and logic
- ✅ `types/database.ts` - Removed `schoolLogoUrl` from `BranchFormData`
- ✅ `SPONSOR_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated to reflect removal

## Current Sponsor Management

### **How to Add Sponsors Now**
Sponsors must be added manually via SQL:
```sql
INSERT INTO sponsors (name, logo_url, sponsor_type, display_order) 
VALUES ('School Name', '/path/to/logo.png', 'school', 1);
```

### **How to Remove Sponsors**
```sql
DELETE FROM sponsors WHERE name = 'School Name';
```

### **View Current Sponsors**
```sql
SELECT * FROM sponsors WHERE is_active = true ORDER BY display_order;
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Workflow**: Branch creation is now focused only on branch management
2. **Cleaner UI**: Reduced form complexity and cognitive load
3. **Better Separation**: Clear distinction between branch management and sponsor management
4. **Reduced Errors**: No more orphaned sponsors from test branches
5. **Manual Control**: Full control over what appears in sponsor carousel

The system now maintains a clean separation between branch management and sponsor curation, allowing for better control over the sponsor carousel content.
