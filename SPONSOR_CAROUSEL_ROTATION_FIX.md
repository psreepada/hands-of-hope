# Sponsor Carousel Rotation Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Autoplay Logic Improvements**
**Problem**: Autoplay was stopping after user interaction and not restarting properly.

**Fixed**:
- Improved autoplay restart logic with proper timeout
- Added better cleanup of intervals
- Enhanced event handling for mouse enter/leave

### 2. **Carousel Configuration**
**Problem**: Default carousel settings might not have been optimal for autoplay.

**Fixed**:
- Added `skipSnaps: false` and `dragFree: false` for better control
- Improved slide sizing from 300px to 280px with smaller margins
- Added transition animations for smoother movement

### 3. **Insufficient Sponsor Count Check**
**Problem**: If there's only one sponsor, the carousel can't rotate.

**Fixed**:
- Added check to only enable autoplay if there are 2+ sponsors
- Added console logging to debug sponsor count issues

### 4. **Scroll Logic Enhancement**
**Problem**: Carousel might get stuck if it can't scroll next.

**Fixed**:
- Added `canScrollNext()` check before scrolling
- If can't scroll next, jumps back to first slide to continue loop
- Better handling of edge cases

### 5. **Enhanced Event Handling**
**Problem**: User interactions could permanently stop autoplay.

**Fixed**:
- Mouse enter/leave events pause/resume autoplay
- Pointer up events restart autoplay after 1 second delay
- Better cleanup of all event listeners

## New Features Added

### **Debug Logging**
- Console logs show how many sponsors are loaded
- Autoplay status logging
- Warning if not enough sponsors for rotation

### **Better User Experience**
- Carousel pauses on hover
- Resumes when mouse leaves
- Smoother transitions
- Better spacing between slides

## Testing the Fix

### **Check Console Logs**
Open browser dev tools and look for:
```
Sponsors loaded: X sponsors
Starting autoplay for X sponsors
```

### **Manual Test**
1. Hover over carousel → should pause
2. Move mouse away → should resume
3. Click/drag → should pause then resume after 1 second

### **Verify Sponsors**
In Supabase, run:
```sql
SELECT name, logo_url, is_active FROM sponsors 
WHERE is_active = true 
ORDER BY display_order;
```

Should show multiple active sponsors for rotation to work.

## Troubleshooting

### **If Still Not Rotating**
1. **Check sponsor count**: Need at least 2 active sponsors
2. **Check console**: Look for error messages
3. **Check network**: Verify sponsor images are loading
4. **Check database**: Run the cleanup script if needed

### **Common Issues**
- **Only 1 sponsor**: Rotation disabled by design
- **Broken images**: Hidden sponsors reduce effective count
- **Database issues**: Orphaned sponsors may cause problems

## Code Changes Made

### **Enhanced Autoplay Logic**
```typescript
// Better interval management
if (emblaApi && emblaApi.canScrollNext()) {
  emblaApi.scrollNext()
} else if (emblaApi && !emblaApi.canScrollNext()) {
  emblaApi.scrollTo(0) // Loop back to start
}
```

### **Improved Event Handling**
```typescript
// Mouse events for better UX
const onMouseEnter = () => stopAutoplay()
const onMouseLeave = () => startAutoplay()
```

### **Carousel Configuration**
```typescript
useEmblaCarousel({
  align: "center",
  loop: true,
  slidesToScroll: 1,
  containScroll: "trimSnaps",
  skipSnaps: false,
  dragFree: false,
})
```

The sponsor carousel should now rotate automatically every 3 seconds, pause on hover, and handle all edge cases properly!
